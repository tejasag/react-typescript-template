# React Typescript Template

This is a React template modified to work with typescript.
This template does not have any files that are not needed when creating a new react app and hence it saves 30 seconds of work yay!

---

## Building from source
- Clone the template
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tejasag/react-typescript-template
```
- Change the title and site description in `public/index.html`
- Replace `public/favicon.ico` with a custom favicon.
- Start the development environnement!
```sh
yarn start
```
